# React-JS
A Project built to manage tasks under different project. I have covered some functionalities like add, delete and list the project along with the tasks


I have used ref, portal, functional components, tailwindcss and implemented this. This project covers some of the core concepts needed to start a react project. 

I'll cover application context and redux in other branches. This projects shows the pain points such as props drilling and the need for state management.

A preview of the project can be seen below.
